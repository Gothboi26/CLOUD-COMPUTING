Cloud computing in education and student's needs

According to Krelja, Rako, & Tomljanovic (2013) Cloud computing usability in education is very broad, 
as recognized by many educational institutions around the world. The reasons for the worldwide 
introduction of cloud computing for educational establishment are mainly of a financial nature, but it 
should be noted that cloud has creative potentials because it enables that ideas, thoughts and 
knowledge can be created, used and shared easily. Students may create their own "Cloud-Based 
Personalized Learning Environment" or use m-learning and access to Open Educational Resources 
from the cloud. However, to achieve this, students and teachers should be willing to use services in 
cloud and be familiar with their advantages and limitations. 
Their study shows that the respondents (students) are often online and at the same time using 
multiple computers and similar devices (tablet computers, smartphones). When using computers, they 
are (on average) sometimes in situations that require the use of applications and services in the cloud. 
The largest use is noted with cloud communication software, the smallest with cloud docs / office 
software. The students have expressed, based on the average of their answers, that they sometimes 
need and use cloud applications / services, which means that they are not yet ready for a "move to 
the cloud". It is necessary to educate and motivate them about cloud applications and services to
make them become aware of the benefits.
