THE ROLE OF CLOUD IN THE EVOLUTION OF GAMING

However, the modern era of gaming has been revolutionized by the cloud. It holds the potential to 
reform and give an entirely new perspective to the masses. It is much better than offline games 
because it allows the players to play against real players and also helps them keep track of their 
performance globally. Also, the creators dont have the burden to create new updates and resell them

without providing bulky updates. In app-purchases become easy with online games. 
There is so much to look forward to when it comes to online gaming. New techniques for faster 
responses are being researched along with easy to deploy methods. The microservices architecture 
has proven itself quite efficient and lightweight for designing such complex systems. It can also be 
optimized for reducing the errors and response failures. This industry has shown promising grown in 
the past decade and has made e-sports popular among the players worldwide. This can boost the 
demand for games and more profits can be made through highly responsive architectures.
