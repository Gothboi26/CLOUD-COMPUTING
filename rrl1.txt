Autonomic to Cloud Computing

How autonomic data security can help define clouds future

According to Chuvakin A., & Stone J., (2022). As data usage has undergone drastic expansion and
changes in the past five years. Technology such as cloud computing and AI have changed how we use
data, derive value from data, and glean insights from data. Data moves, shifts, and replicates, as you
mingle data sets and gain new value in the process. All the while, your data resides in and is being
created in new places.
A relatively new concept, autonomic data security is security thats been integrated with data
throughout its lifecycle. It can make things easier on users by freeing them from defining and 
redefining myriad rules about who can do what, when, where. Its an approach that keeps pace with 
constantly evolving cyberthreats and business changes. 
Autonomic data security can help you keep your IT assets more secure and can make your business 
and IT processes snanopeedier. For example, data sharing with partners and data access decisions 
simultaneously becomes faster and more secure. This may sound like magic, but in fact relies on a 
constant willingness to change and adapt to both business changes and threat evolution.
